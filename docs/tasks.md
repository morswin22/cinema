# Cinema Application Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the Cinema application. Each task is designed to enhance the codebase's quality, maintainability, and functionality.

## Architecture and Code Organization

1. [ ] Refactor the application to follow a more explicit architecture pattern (e.g., Clean Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture)
2. [ ] Create a clear separation between domain logic, application services, and infrastructure code
3. [ ] Move database operations from handlers to dedicated repository modules
4. [ ] Implement a proper dependency injection pattern instead of passing the database pool directly
5. [ ] Create a configuration module to centralize all application settings
6. [ ] Standardize error handling across all modules
7. [ ] Extract business logic from handlers into service modules

## Error Handling

8. [ ] Replace all `unwrap()` and `expect()` calls with proper error handling
9. [ ] Create a consistent error handling strategy across the application
10. [ ] Implement custom error types for domain-specific errors
11. [ ] Add context to errors for better debugging
12. [ ] Improve error messages to be more user-friendly
13. [ ] Fix the use of HTTP 418 (I'm a teapot) status code for login/register errors

## Testing

14. [ ] Implement unit tests for all business logic
15. [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
16. [ ] Create database migration tests
17. [ ] Implement property-based testing for critical components
18. [ ] Set up test fixtures and factories for test data
19. [ ] Add test coverage reporting
20. [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Documentation

21. [ ] Add comprehensive documentation to all public functions and types
22. [ ] Create API documentation with examples
23. [ ] Document the database schema and relationships
24. [ ] Add README.md with setup instructions and project overview
25. [ ] Document the application architecture and design decisions
26. [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
27. [ ] Create user documentation for the application

## Performance

28. [ ] Implement pagination for listing endpoints (movies, reservations)
29. [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
30. [ ] Optimize database queries (review for N+1 problems)
31. [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
32. [ ] Implement connection pooling configuration tuning
33. [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
34. [ ] Optimize template rendering

## Security

35. [ ] Implement CSRF protection for all forms
36. [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
37. [ ] Implement proper password validation rules
38. [ ] Add email verification for new user registrations
39. [ ] Implement secure session management with proper cookie settings
40. [ ] Add input validation for all user inputs
41. [ ] Implement proper authorization checks for all endpoints
42. [ ] Add security headers to HTTP responses
43. [ ] Implement audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Maintainability

44. [ ] Add linting rules and code formatting
45. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
46. [ ] Implement database migrations management
47. [ ] Add logging throughout the application
48. [ ] Create development environment setup scripts
49. [ ] Implement feature flags for easier feature rollout
50. [ ] Add health check endpoints
51. [ ] Implement graceful shutdown

## User Experience

52. [ ] Improve error messages in the UI
53. [ ] Add form validation feedback on the client side
54. [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile users
55. [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
56. [ ] Implement user profile management
57. [ ] Add password reset functionality
58. [ ] Improve accessibility of the UI

## DevOps and Infrastructure

60. [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
61. [ ] Implement database backup and restore procedures
62. [ ] Create deployment documentation
63. [ ] Set up staging and production environments
64. [ ] Implement blue-green deployment strategy
65. [ ] Add infrastructure as code (IaC) for deployment

## Data Management

66. [ ] Implement soft delete for entities
67. [ ] Add created_at and updated_at timestamps to all entities
68. [ ] Implement data validation at the model level
69. [ ] Add data migration scripts for schema changes
